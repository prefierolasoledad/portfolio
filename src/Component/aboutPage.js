                <p>
                    Welcome to my digital playground! I'm Karan Bhatt, a second-year student at the University School of Automation and Robotics (USAR). 
                    My journey in the world of technology is just beginning, but trust me, it’s already a wild ride!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve dived headfirst into the realms of coding, creating projects that not only challenge my skills but also ignite my passion for innovation. 
                    From building robots that can dance to crafting websites that dazzle, I’m all about pushing boundaries and having fun while doing it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not knee-deep in code, you can find me dreaming up my next big idea or binge-watching the latest tech documentaries. Join me on this 
                    adventure, and let’s create something extraordinary together!
                </p>
